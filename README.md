The task here was to reconstruct an Apple homepage from several years ago. This project was great practice at working with images as backgrounds as well as flexbox. 

Project is not responsive, as responsive design comes later in the curriculum. 

Written with CSS and HTML. 

Completed as a part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a> curriculum.
